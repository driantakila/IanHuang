# DineWatchdog: NLP-Driven Restaurant Review Analytics

[**View Jupyter Notebook (Code)**](./Final_DineWatchdog.ipynb)

## 📌 Project Overview
DineWatchdog is an end-to-end data analytics project designed to help restaurant managers in Los Angeles extract actionable insights from customer feedback. By combining **Web Scraping**, **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and **Sentiment Analysis**, this project identifies key service gaps that star ratings alone fail to reveal.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Developed a custom scraper to collect real-time textual review data from restaurant listing platforms.
- **Text Processing Pipeline**: Implemented a comprehensive NLP pipeline including tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, and POS tagging (focusing on nouns and adjectives).
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Applied advanced NLP techniques to classify customer emotions and correlate them with numerical ratings.
- **Topic Modeling & Visualization**: Generated **Word Cloud maps** to visualize recurring themes such as "wait times," "service quality," and "value perception."

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud
- **Methodology**: TF-IDF Vectorization, Sentiment Classification, Web Crawling

## 📊 Key Findings & Business Value
Based on the analysis of the Los Angeles restaurant market:
- **Service Quality vs. Food**: Analysis revealed that issues such as **long wait times** and **inconsistent staff attitude** are primary sources of dissatisfaction, often outweighing food quality.
- **Sentiment Mismatch**: Identified cases where high star ratings contained negative textual sentiment, providing a more nuanced view of restaurant performance.
- **Actionable Guidance**: The findings help managers optimize service quality and manage value perception to enhance customer loyalty.
