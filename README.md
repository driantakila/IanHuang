## 🔍 Project Details

### 💎 Customer Analytics & Loyalty Prediction (Machine Learning)
[**View Jupyter Notebook (Code)**](./Huang_Y_finalproject.ipynb)

#### 🎥 Project Presentation & Code Walkthrough
To demonstrate the full analytical lifecycle of this project, I have recorded a comprehensive two-part walkthrough:

- [**Video Section 1: Business Intelligence & Data Exploration**](https://youtu.be/Kf_emwlx4wM)
  *Covers: Data cleaning, correlation analysis, and identifying key drivers of customer engagement through pivot tables and visualization.*

- [**Video Section 2: Machine Learning & Dimensionality Reduction**](https://youtu.be/LoTIQKyX3j4)
  *Covers: Implementing PCA for feature engineering, building Random Forest classification models, and evaluating regression performance for ticket forecasting.*

> **Key Takeaway:** These presentations demonstrate my ability to not only build complex models but also to articulate technical findings to business stakeholders, bridging the gap between data and strategy.

> **Note:** In these videos, I explain the underlying logic of the PCA dimensionality reduction and the performance comparison between the Classification and Regression models.

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer loyalty levels (Premier vs. Insider) and ticket consumption for a service-based business. It utilizes advanced statistical modeling to help the company identify high-value customers and optimize marketing resource allocation.

#### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed Classification models (Random Forest/Logistic Regression) to predict membership conversion and Regression models for consumption forecasting.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce feature noise and improve model computational efficiency.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzed demographic and behavioral data (e.g., age, income, engagement frequency) to profile "Premier" vs "Insider" users.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified that Premier users are significantly more responsive to mobile/email promotions, providing a clear target for marketing campaigns.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, PCA

### 🍕 DineWatchdog: NLP-Driven Restaurant Review Analytics
[**View Jupyter Notebook (Code)**](./Final_DineWatchdog.ipynb)

#### 📌 Project Overview
DineWatchdog is an end-to-end NLP project that scrapes and analyzes LA restaurant reviews to identify service gaps that numerical ratings fail to reveal.

#### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Collected real-time textual data from review platforms.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Implemented tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classified customer emotions to identify recurring pain points like "wait times" and "staff attitude."

### 📈 Taiwan ETF Investment Strategy (Quantitative Finance)
[**View R Script (Code)**](./CAPE_Strategy_Backtest.R) 

#### 📌 Project Overview
This project, derived from my Master’s thesis, develops a systematic ETF investment strategy for the Taiwan stock market. By integrating the **Shiller PE Ratio (CAPE Ratio)** with **Moving Average (MA)** technical indicators, the study aims to filter market noise and identify robust entry/exit signals for long-term wealth management.

#### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Quantitative Backtesting**: Developed a rigorous backtesting framework in **R** to evaluate strategy performance over a 15-year period (including the 2008 Financial Crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic).
- **Valuation Modeling**: Calculated the CAPE Ratio for the TAIEX and Taiwan 50 indices, adjusting corporate earnings for inflation to provide a normalized market valuation.
- **Signal Engineering**: Implemented multiple Moving Average periods (MA4, MA8, MA12) to generate systematic trading signals, effectively reducing emotional bias in investment decisions.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Compared the strategy against the "Buy & Hold" benchmark, finding that the CAPE-MA12 strategy significantly outperformed in large-cap ETFs (e.g., 0050) by minimizing drawdowns during market downturns.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: R
- **Key Concepts**: Quantitative Backtesting, Financial Econometrics, CAPE Ratio, Moving Average, Portfolio Management

![Air Travel Safety Dashboard](./air_safety_dashboard.png)

#### 📌 Overview
Transformed 14 years of NTSB aviation incident data into a strategic narrative. Analyzed safety records through the lens of **Insurance Risk Assessment** and **Tourism Development**.

#### 🚀 Key Highlights
- **Narrative-Driven Analysis**: Developed a "Data Story" that guides stakeholders from broad global statistics to specific regional risk clusters.
- **Geographic Risk Mapping**: Visualized incident density to provide actionable safety ratings for corporate travel planning.

![Apple Supply Chain Dashboard](./apple_supply_chain.png)

#### 📌 Overview
Utilizing the **TEJ PRO** database, this project evaluates the financial health and market competitiveness of Apple’s top 10 Taiwanese suppliers (e.g., TSMC, Foxconn) from 2015 to 2025.

#### 🚀 Key Highlights
- **R&D vs. Profitability**: Quantified the correlation between Research & Development investment and net profit margins.
- **Financial Benchmarking**: Created a comparative framework to track Revenue, EPS, and Asset Efficiency across the semiconductor sector.
