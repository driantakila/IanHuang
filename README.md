- [**Video Section 2 Machine Learning**](https://youtu.be/LoTIQKyX3j4)

> **Note:** In these videos, I explain the underlying logic of the PCA dimensionality reduction and the performance comparison between the Classification and Regression models.
#### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer loyalty levels (Premier vs. Insider) and ticket consumption for a service-based business. It utilizes advanced statistical modeling to help the company identify high-value customers and optimize marketing resource allocation.

#### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Predictive Modeling**: Developed Classification models (Random Forest/Logistic Regression) to predict membership conversion and Regression models for consumption forecasting.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Applied **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to reduce feature noise and improve model computational efficiency.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Analyzed demographic and behavioral data (e.g., age, income, engagement frequency) to profile "Premier" vs "Insider" users.
- **Actionable Insights**: Identified that Premier users are significantly more responsive to mobile/email promotions, providing a clear target for marketing campaigns.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, PCA

### 🍕 DineWatchdog: NLP-Driven Restaurant Review Analytics
[**View Jupyter Notebook (Code)**](./Final_DineWatchdog.ipynb)

#### 📌 Project Overview
DineWatchdog is an end-to-end NLP project that scrapes and analyzes LA restaurant reviews to identify service gaps that numerical ratings fail to reveal.

#### 🚀 Key Technical Highlights
- **Automated Web Scraping**: Collected real-time textual data from review platforms.
- **NLP Pipeline**: Implemented tokenization, lemmatization, and POS tagging.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classified customer emotions to identify recurring pain points like "wait times" and "staff attitude."
